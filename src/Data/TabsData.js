    "Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is the term used to describe the practice of transferring end-of-life management of products and materials to the makers of those goods. i.e. the producer. The Guidelines offer a framework to improve the cycle economy of plastic packaging waste, encourage the creation of novel plastic substitutes, and outline further steps firms can take to transition to sustainable plastic packaging. In order to limit the use of new plastic material for packaging, the standards require the reuse of rigid plastic packaging materials. The Guidelines outline a framework for collecting environmental compensation based on the polluter pays principle from producers, importers, and brand owners who fail to meet extended producer responsibility targets in order to safeguard the environment, improve its quality, and stop, control, and mitigate environmental pollution. The cash raised must be used for the environmentally responsible collection, recycling, and end-of-life disposal of uncollected plastic garbage.",
    "India is believed to generate 25,00 tons of plastic waste every day. So much so that plastic is entering the food chain. This can alter human hormones and cause life-threatening diseases. Thus, it is imperative for governments to step up and enforce laws to combat this crisis. For this Government introduces the term Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) in the 2016 Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016.",
